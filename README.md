things to look into that could be useful extensions to this repo

- eslint shared config
- github actions for auto lint, test, build, secret scanning, etc
- github protection rules for main branch only merge-able / publishable via CI
- standardized commit messages + automatic changelog (see commitizen and lint-staged / husky
- semantic release or similar for releasing packages
- tsdoc for generating documentation from code both internal and for external use (we don't need to make it formalized, but i think just having something written for inline documentation would be super helpful for other devs to understand what's going on)

other misc things that might improve Q.o.L.

- fig.io for autocomplete in the terminal, but also sharing of `.env` secrets and stuff
- automated slack notifications for CI / maybe on chain events?
- sentry for error tracking (not sure if this is necessary, but it's a nice to have)
- retool for building internal tooling without needing to code the UI

if you have more ideas, please add them here
